- 👋 Hi, I’m @food-spotter
- 👀 I’m interested in food, travelling for food, and nutrition of food.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about life, the universe and everything. Apparently the answer maybe 42, but I may need to write some code to reverse engineer this answer to understand if the original question was the same.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on music tracks and open source data related projects.
